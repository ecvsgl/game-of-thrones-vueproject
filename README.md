This is a Vue.js mini project that uses the API endpoints of https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/

Project stack uses SASS preprocessors for CSS generation, routing mechanism of vue-router (tried
not to use Axios) is used to switch in between different Views. JS scripts are used for JSON 
deserialization. In styling, Bootstrap buttons and table styles are used. No DB is running to log 
activity.

a SPA. Quotes are generated randomly from the API, as seen in the homepage. Character-house details
are given in the other two views.
